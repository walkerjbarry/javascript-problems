<!--Create a basic HTML page with a P element and a button on it.

Then, write a JavaScript function to set the background color of that paragraph using an "onclick" event added to a button in the UI.

STEP 1. Create the basic HTML page with the requested elements. This one is pretty straighforward.  The only wrinkle, is that I added the meta tags to ensure the UTF-8 character set is used, and the site is mobile-responsive, just to try to galvanize good habits. 

STEP 2. I gave the <p></p> element some content, so that it will have something to change the background OF. 

STEP3. Give the <button></button> element the onclick behavior of changeColor()-->
